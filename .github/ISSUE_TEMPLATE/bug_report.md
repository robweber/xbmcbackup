Before working on a new issue I'm probably going to ask you all this stuff anyway, probably just easier to provide it now.....

**Describe the problem**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

**Platform and Kodi version**
What OS and Kodi version are you using? (Rpi, Android, etc)

**Link to Debug Log**
Don't just post the whole thing here,  use [https://paste.kodi.tv](https://paste.kodi.tv)
